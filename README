SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: 

rTANDEM uses 'expat' and 'pthreads' libraries. Their avalability might vary according to operating system.

The eXpat library should be available on OSX (since 10.4).
The eXpat library for linux can be downloaded at http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/files. 
The eXpat library for Windows can be downloaded at http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/files . 

pthreads:
The pthreads library should be available on OSX since 10.3.
The pthreads library is available on most linux plateforms.
A version of pthread is available for win-32 and can be downloaded at http://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32. (Unfortunately, this prevents the use of pthreads on x64 windows for now.)
