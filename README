SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: 

rTANDEM uses 'expat' and 'pthread' libraries. Their avalability might vary according to operating system.

expat:
The expat library should be available on OSX since 10.4.
The expat library for linux can be downloaded at http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/files. 
The expat library for Windows can be downloaded at http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/files. 

pthread:
The pthread library should be available on OSX since 10.3.
The pthread library is available on most linux plateforms.
A version of pthread is available for win-32 and can be downloaded at http://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32.

When building from sources on Windows systems, linking against the expat library can be problematic. To circumvent this difficulty, create a directory structure like this one: 
C:\expat\i386
C:\expat\x64
Then place the 32 bit and 64 bits libraries respectively in C:\expat\i386\lib and C:\expat\x64\lib. Finally, create an environment variable LIB_EXPAT and set it to "C:/expat/". This should allow the build process to sucessfully link against the expat libraries.
Alternatively, you have the libraries in any directory structure if you put the path to the libraries in the respective environment variable LIB_EXPAT_32 and LIB_EXPAT_64.
