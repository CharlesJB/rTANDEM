SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: 

rTANDEM uses 'expat' and 'pthread' libraries. Their avalability might vary according to operating system.

expat:
The expat library should be available on OSX since 10.4.
The expat library for linux can be downloaded at http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/files. 
The expat library for Windows can be downloaded at http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/files. 

pthread:
The pthread library should be available on OSX since 10.3.
The pthread library is available on most linux plateforms.
A version of pthread is available for win-32 and can be downloaded at http://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32.

To build rTANDEM from sources on Windows systems, you will need the required libraries. And you will need to set two environment variables: LIB_EXPAT_32 and LIB_EXPAT_64 to the paths corresponding to the 32 and x64 expat libraries.
