Bug fix (memory management problem in Cpp)

2013-09-23
More parameters are added to the rTParam class. x!tandem 
supported but undocumented parameters are now listed. 

2013-07-26
rTANDEM is now fully based on the 'jackhammer-2013.06.15'
version of X!Tandem.

Corrected a bug that would crash rTANDEM when using multi-
threading.
Corrected a bug that could affect the results when multiple
fasta files are assigned to a same taxon.
